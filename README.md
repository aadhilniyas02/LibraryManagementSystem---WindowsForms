# Library Management System - Windows Forms
I developed a Library Management System (LMS) using C# Windows Forms and MS SQL Server. This system features both admin and member login options, with a registration process for new members. Admins can add and remove books, monitor availability, manage the libraryâ€™s collection, and view transaction histories, while members can register, log in, browse available books, and borrow and return books. The application includes a database for real-time updates on availability and robust error handling to prevent issues like duplicate borrowing of unavailable items. This project enhanced my skills in C# and database management, emphasizing logic handling and user interaction in a Windows Forms environment.
